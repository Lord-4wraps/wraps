            <h3>As you begin to explore a possible career in web development, you might wonder what a front end developer does.</h3>
            <p>Simply put, we focus on a website’s visitor-facing aspects; as opposed to a back end developer, who focuses on behind the scenes work; or a full stack developer who works on both sides.

                Their Responsibilities and Skills Go Hand in Hand
                Many actions a developer performs daily require skills like JavaScript or HTML coding, with a great deal of overlap in their day-to-day responsibilities.

                What a Front End Developer Does: An Overview
                A front end developer has one general responsibility: to ensure that website visitors can easily interact with the page. They do this through the combination of design, technology and programming to code a website’s appearance, as well as taking care of debugging. Whenever you visit a website, anything that you see, click on or otherwise use is the work of a front end developer.
